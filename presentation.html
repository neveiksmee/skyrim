    <h1>Skyrim Songs</h1>
    <h3>Song of The Dragonborn</h3>
    
    <p>We drink to our youth, to days come and gone<br>
        For the Age of Aggression is just about done<br>
        We'll drive out the Stormcloaks and restore what we own<br>
        With our blood and our steel we'll take back our home<br>
        Down with Ulfric, the killer of kings!<br>
        On the day of your death we'll drink and we'll sing<br>
        We're the children of Skyrim, and we fight all our lives<br>
        And when Sovngarde beckons everyone of us dies<br>
        But this land is ours and we'll see it wiped clean<br>
        Of the scourge that has sullied our hopes and our dreams</p>
        <h3>Age of Oppression</h3>
        
        <p>Oh there once was a hero named Ragnar the Red<br>
            Who came riding to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead<br>
            And the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade<br>
            As he told of bold battles and gold he had made<br>
            But then he went quiet, did Ragnar the Red<br>
            When he met the shield-maiden Matilda, who said:<br>
            'Oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead,<br>
            Now I think it's high time that you lie down and bleed!'<br>
            And so then came clashing and slashing of steel,<br>
            As the brave lass Matilda charged in, full of zeal<br>
            And the braggart named Ragnar was boastful no more...<br>
            When his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!</p>
